dlg-neu icons in Noosfero
=========================

The icons in this directory are taken from the icon themes for GNOME.
We take the SVG files and convert to 64x64 PNG images.

Structure
=========

To keep a trace back to the theme theme, when rasterizing the SVG files we keep
the original filenames (replacing .svg by .png, obviously) and create symbolic
links with names more sensible for Noosfero.

Adding a new icons
==================

Use the fantastic script get-icon.sh! Suppose you want to add a new icon for
the "favorites". You find that dlg-neu theme has a nice button under apps,
called gtk-open.svg. You call the script as follows:

$ sh get-icon.sh favorites dlg-neu apps/epiphany-bookmarks.svg

The script generates the PNG and create symbolic link from PNG using ICON name.

Icons rasterization
===================

With rsvg, from the librsvg2-bin package (i.e. we use the same rasterization
library as GNOME, so the icons must look like they do in GNOME).

$ rsvg -w 64 -h 64 user_icon.svg user_icon.png
