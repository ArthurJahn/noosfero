* ruby-get-text incmopatible with rails3. Maybe we can use it's gem

* all js code is inside miscellaneous.js. Would be nice to refactor this

* rails 2 uses prototype instead of jquery

* config/environment.rb maybe still have some code that should be on the initializers

* initializers session_store.rb inflections.rb... don't exist

* rails gems version have to be forced on Gemfile or it will use incompatible pre3vious versions (3.1.3)

* Sweepers are now natively supported on Rails 3. Would be nice to refactor it

* On Rails 3 it is no more possible to add allowed tags to avoid scape. The html_safe initializer is an option.

* controller_paths are no more supported on Rails 3
