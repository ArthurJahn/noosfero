* ruby-get-text incmopatible with rails3. Maybe we can use it's gem

* all js code is inside miscellaneous.js. Would be nice to refactor this

* config/environment.rb maybe still have some code that should be on the initializers

* initializers session_store.rb inflections.rb... don't exist

* rails gems version have to be forced on Gemfile or it will use incompatible pre3vious versions (3.1.3)

* error when call sqlite_extensiosn

* error related to action_tracker

* check FIXME's in script/quick-start

* check FIXME's in Gemfile

* rewrite config/routes.rb
