== Setting up a Noosfero development/test environment

Noosfero is written in Ruby with the "Rails framework":http://www.rubyonrails.org,
so the process of setting it up is pretty similar to other Rails applications.

=== Requirements

You need to have a Subversion client (svn) installed, as well as:

* Ruby:http://www.ruby-lang.org/
* Rake:http://rake.rubyforge.org/
* Ruby-GetText:http://www.yotabanana.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html?ruby-gettext
* Mocha:http://mocha.rubyforge.org/
* Ruby-sqlite3:http://rubyforge.org/projects/sqlite-ruby

There are Debian packages available for all of them. Try:

 # aptitude install svn ruby rake libgettext-ruby libmocha-ruby libsqlite3-ruby

If you have problems with the setup, use the development mailing list. In
special its possible that the requirements list above is not complete.

=== Boostraping the test environment

You can copy and paste the commands below into a terminal (please review the
commands and make sure you understand what you are doing):

 # checkout the code from repository
 svn checkout https://svn.colivre.coop.br/svn/noosfero/trunk/ noosfero
 # enter the directory
 cd noosfero
 # copy a sample config file
 cp config/database.yml.sqlite3 config/database.yml
 # create the database:
 rake db:migrate      
 # compile translations:
 rake makemo
 # create some test data:
 ./script/populate
 # run the automated test suite to make sure your environment is sane:
 rake test

You should now be ready to go. Issue the following command to start the Rails
development server:

 ./script/server

The server will be available at http://localhost:3000/ . If you want to use
another port than 3000, you can use the -p option of ./script/server:

 ./script/server -p 9999

The above command makes the server available at http://localhost:9999/

The populate script creates some test users, one of them has login 'ze' and
password 'test'. You can use it or you can register a new user.

== Reporting bugs

Use Noosfero Tracker application at http://www.colivre.coop.br/Noosfero.

== Helping with development

* It's recommended that you subscribe to the "development mailing
  list":http://ynternet.net/mailman/listinfo/noosfero
* If you have a patch, create an appropriate action item
  (bugs/requirement/enhancement) in the Tracker web (see "Reporting bugs"
  above) of type.
