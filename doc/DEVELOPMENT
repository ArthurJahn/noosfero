== Setting up a Noosfero development/test environment

=== Requirements

You need to have a Subversion client (svn) installed, as well as Ruby:http://www.ruby-lang.org/, Rake:http://rake.rubyforge.org/, Ruby-GetText:http://www.yotabanana.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html?ruby-gettext, Mocha:http://mocha.rubyforge.org/ and maybe others.

There are Debian packages available for all of them. Try:

 # aptitude install svn ruby rake libgettext-ruby libmocha-ruby

If you have problems with the setup, use the development mailing list.

=== Getting Noosfero source

 $ svn checkout https://svn.colivre.coop.br/svn/noosfero/trunk/ noosfero
 $ cd noosfero
 $ cp config/database.yml.sqlite3 config/database.yml
 $ rake db:migrate

You should now be ready to go. Issue the following command to start the Rails
development server:

 $ ./script/server

The server will be available at http://localhost:3000/ . If you want to use
another port than 3000, you can use the -p option of ./script/server:

 & ./script/server -p 9999

The above command makes the server available at http://localhost:9999/

== Reporting bugs

Use Noosfero Tracker application at http://www.colivre.coop.br/Noosfero.

== Helping with development

* It's recommended that you subscribe to the "development mailing list":http://ynternet.net/mailman/listinfo/noosfero
* If you have a patch, create an appropriate action item (bugs/requirement/enhancement) in the Tracker web (see "Reporting bugs" above) of type.
