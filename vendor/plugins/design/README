= Design

Design is a Rails plugin that helps you to set different, custom designs for
your Rails application, or event letting your users do so.

== On what we mean by 'design'

By 'design', we mean a set of elements that are taken together to built
your application's visual identity. In this plugin, you'll work with the 
following elements:

* *template* - definition of the how much boxes the visual identity will have, together with their sizes and positions.
* *theme* - CSS definition for fonts, colors, backgrounds and 
* *icon_theme* - set of icons to be used as action buttons in your application.

== Declaring and using usign in controllers

(the settings names are fictional)

 class MyController < ActionController::Base

   box1 = Design::Box.new(:number => 1)
   box1.blocks << Design::Block.new(:position => 1) do
     "Welcome to my website!"
   end

   box2 = Design::Box.new(:number => 2)
   box2.blocks << Design::MainBlock.new(:position => 1)

   box3 = Design::Box.new(:number => 3)
   box3.blocks << Design::Block.new(:position => 1) do
     "This in my footer"
   end
   
   design :fixed => {
     :template => 'header_main_footer',
     :theme => 'green_fields',
     :icon_theme => 'discrete',
     :boxes => [ box1, box2, box3 ]
   }
 end

Design will then know that your design has three boxes, each one with a block inside it. To use Design as your layout generator, you just add something like this in aplicattion's layout:

 <%= design_display_boxes(yield) %>

The argument do +design_display_boxes()+ is the content you want to be the main
content. Almost always you'll want to pass +yield+ (the resulting content for
the current action) there, but you can pass anything you want.

== Storing design information in ActiveRecord models: +acts_as_design+

You can also use ActiveRecord objects
