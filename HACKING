= Noosfero instructions for developers

This document provides useful information to those who want to help with
Noosfero development.

== Requirements for development

* Mocha: http://mocha.rubyforge.org/
* Tidy: http://tidy.sourceforge.net/
* Hpricot: http://github.com/whymirror/hpricot
* Imagemagick: http://wwwimagemagick.org/

You must install these packages to be able to run Noosfero tests. On Debian
GNU/Linux you install them with the following command:

 apt-get install libtidy-ruby libhpricot-ruby libmocha-ruby imagemagick

== Boostraping a development/test environment

You can copy and paste the commands below into a terminal (please review the
commands and make sure you understand what you are doing):

 # checkout the code from repository
 git clone git://git.colivre.coop.br/noosfero.git
 # enter the directory
 cd noosfero
 # copy a sample config file
 cp config/database.yml.sqlite3 config/database.yml
 # create the database:
 rake db:migrate
 # compile translations:
 rake makemo
 # create some test data:
 ./script/sample-data
 # run the automated test suite to make sure your environment is sane:
 rake test

You should now be ready to go. Issue the following command to start the Rails
development server:

 ./script/server

The server will be available at http://localhost:3000/ . If you want to use
another port than 3000, you can use the -p option of ./script/server:

 ./script/server -p 9999

The above command makes the server available at http://localhost:9999/

The sample-data data scripts creates one administrator user with login "ze" and
password "test".
