  # This method can return several types of objects:

  # * <tt>String</tt>: if the string starts with <tt>http://</tt> or <tt>https://</tt>, then it is assumed to be address of an IFRAME. Otherwise it's is used as regular HTML.
  # * <tt>Hash</tt>: the hash is used to build an URL that is used as the address for a IFRAME. 
  # * <tt>Proc</tt>: the Proc is evaluated in the scope of BoxesHelper. The
  # block can then use <tt>render</tt>, <tt>link_to</tt>, etc.
  #
  # The method can also return <tt>nil</tt>, which means "no content".
