CMS editors for Noosfero
========================

This directory contains code for custom content editors in Noosfero.

Creating a new editor
=====================

:: File structure

Let's say that you are implementingn and editor for type, say, "foo/bar". Then
you have to create:

  * app/controllers/my_profile/cms/foo_bar.html
  * app/views/cms/foo_bar_*.rhtml (one view for each action you define in the
    controller class, if applicable).

:: Coding conventions

You file must add methods to CmsController class. They are going to be loaded
after the cms_controller.rb file itself, to you don't need to care about
declaring the superclass:

  class CmsController
    def foo_bar_edit
      # code for preparing the "edit" view
    end

    def foo_bar_new
      # code for preparing the "new" view
    end

    # etc ...
  end

Note that *all* of your actions must be prefixed with the content type (e.g.
"foor_bar_" for "foo/bar"), in order to avoid conflicts.

The views for those actions can be thrown in app/views/cms/, just like other
views for this controller.
